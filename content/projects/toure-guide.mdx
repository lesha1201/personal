## Description

This project was for a private local tour guide. The client needed a website
that tells about their services, shows a list of excursions and their
contacts.

The design was made in Adobe XD.

Since that project needed SEO, I decided to use Gatsby to staticly build
the website. That was my first time trying SSG in React and Gatsby.

## Responsibilities

- Working closely with the client
- Design the website
- Develop the website

## Things I've learned

- SSG in React
- Gatsby
- UI/UX design
- Adobe XD
