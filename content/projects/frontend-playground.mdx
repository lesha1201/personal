## Idea

The idea of this project was to have an environment where I can try new things
on frontend. During this project I tried the new Next.js app directory,
serverless components, and Tailwind for the first time. I also made a UI design
and learned Figma quite a lot.

## Things I've learned

- React serverless components
- Next.js App Router
- Tailwind
- Figma
