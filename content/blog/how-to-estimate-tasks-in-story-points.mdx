## Introduction

Estimating story points may be a term you've come across in software
development, as it is a common method used by teams to estimate the effort
required to complete tasks. Unfortunately, without a deeper understanding of how
or why it works, this method can be misused by teams and can even lead to
unintended consequences and valuable time wasted.

This article will break down the fundamentals of what story points are and
provide a step-by-step guide on how to use them to estimate tasks in software
development teams.

Here's what we'll cover:

- What are story points?
- How to estimate in story points?
- Why use story points?
- Examples of using story points

At the end, you will find additional resources that can help you deepen your
understanding of story points more.

## What are story points?

Story points are an abstract unit of measurement to estimate the overall effort.
Story points are a flexible and elegant method as they can take into account
different factors based on your team's needs such as time, complexity, amount of
work, risks and uncertainties, etc.

The tasks are estimated in story points relative to each other. That's why it's
important to have some baseline tasks that you have estimated together with your
team and have discussed that estimation in detail. This will serve as a
benchmark for everyone to estimate the other tasks.

Story points are usually assigned using a scale such as the Fibonacci sequence
(1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.). It's not a requirement to use this particular
scale, you can use any scale that works for you. The advantage of the Fibonacci
sequence is that it's a non-linear sequence that brings the following
properties:

- Represents well the idea that estimating a task becomes less precise as the
  task becomes larger.
- Illustrates well the idea of relative sizing. Using a linear scale (e.g., 1,
  2, 3, 4, 5) might give the false impression that each story point is the same
  amount more complex as the one before. The Fibonacci sequence avoids this
  pitfall by emphasizing that the relationship between sizes is approximate and
  non-linear. The ratio between values is more important than the values itself.

## How to estimate in story points?

### 1. Define factors of story points

Before using story points, you need to define what a story point represents. You
need to think about which factors are the most important for your team and
describe them in detail.

> The factors can vary between teams and projects.

In this guide, we will be using the following factors:

#### ‚åö Time

Even though Time isn't usually listed as a factor in other guides, I believe
that it's quite an important one for tasks that are clear (usually small tasks).
Instead of trying to give a precise amount of time to implement a task, it's
better to use an approximate amount which improves the accuracy of estimations
and makes it easier to estimate. If it's too hard to predict, we give our
estimate based on other factors. If other factors differ a lot from the time,
then it can mean that you need to revisit your estimation.

**Questions**

- How long does it take to complete the task approximately?

**Options**

- 0 - 2 hours
- 3 - 8 hours
- 9 - 16 hours
- 17 - 26 hours
- 27 - 40 hours
- Unknown

#### üß† Complexity

Complexity takes into account such things as a need for special knowledge,
clarity of implementation, amount of edge cases, etc.

**Questions**

- How hard is it to complete this task?
- Do you need special knowledge to complete this task?
- Is the solution clear or does it require some time to come up with a solution?

**Options**

- Lowest
- Low
- Medium
- High
- Highest

#### üõ†Ô∏è Amount of work

Amount of work assesses the sheer volume of work required to complete a task.
This factor is quite related to Time but answers different questions. It's often
the case when it's hard to estimate time but it's clear that you need to write a
lot of code or you need to do some research before implementing a task.

**Questions**

- Does it require writing a lot of code?
- How much work needs to be done?
- How much do you need to research?

**Options**

- Lowest
- Low
- Medium
- High
- Highest

#### üí£ Risk and uncertainty

Risk and uncertainty take into account things you can't know until starting a
task. For example, you can't envision what issues you will stumble across during
an upgrade of some library to a major version even when it has clear release
notes.

**Questions**

- How much is known about a task?
- Is the task clear?
- Is there something that's hard to predict?

**Options**

- None
- Low
- Medium
- High
- Highest

In the Examples section, we will use those factors, commenting on a decision for
each of them.

### 2. Determine your story point sequence

Your team needs to have a limited set of possible story points to make the
estimation process more accurate and easier. It's not that important the actual
values of story points. It can be numbers or even letters (e.g. S, M, L, see
[T-shirt sizing](https://asana.com/resources/t-shirt-sizing)). But the values
should be relative to each other and easy to understand.

Some popular choices are:

- [Fibonacci sequence](https://www.avion.io/blog/story-points-fibonacci/#the-fibonacci-sequence)
  (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
- [T-shirt sizing](https://asana.com/resources/t-shirt-sizing) (XS, S, M, L, XL)

It's usually a good idea to have a small set of story points (~5 options)
because as an estimate becomes bigger it becomes less accurate. When your
estimate is big for a task, it's a good sign that you need to break the task
down into smaller tasks and estimate them separately.

In this guide, we will be using the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8).

### 3. Create a story point matrix

A story point matrix helps your team to estimate tasks by accumulating all the
factors. It makes estimations more consistent, helps the team to be on the same
page when it comes to estimations and to argue the estimation.

### 4. Explain the concept to the team

Once you set the definition of a story point, determined a sequence, and created
a story point matrix, now it's time to explain it to the team and show how to
use it. It's important that each team member understands the concept.

### 5. Prepare baseline tasks for future estimates

You need to select some tasks that will act as a reference/baseline for future
estimates and estimate them in detail together with a team using the matrix. It
will simplify the estimation process a lot in the future and will make story
points and the matrix much clearer.

The more you use story points, the more accurate estimates become so feel free
to change baseline tasks from time to time.

Ideally, you need to have at least one baseline task for each story point value
you have.

### 6. Set up a poker planning session

Poker planning helps to organize the estimation process. The idea of poker
planning is that each participant estimates a task in story points privately and
the result isn't shown until the voting is over. If the story points are the
same, move on to the next task. If the story points differ much, it's time to
discuss it together and clarify why participants chose a certain amount of story
points.

There are a lot of tools for this. In our team, we use Slack for communication
and it has a good extension
["Poker Planner for Slack"](https://deniz.co/slack-poker-planner/). It has all
the configurations we need, it's easy to use, and makes it possible to make the
session asynchronous.

### 7. Execute your sprint and measure its velocity

The beautiful side of estimation is that it allows us to measure a team's
velocity. The velocity is the measure of a team's capacity to complete work
during a sprint. Story points improve accuracy by having a limited amount of
values and taking into account multiple factors. Knowing the team's velocity
helps to see potential issues, discuss them with the team, and set realistic
goals for the next sprints.

To calculate the velocity, you just need to calculate the total amount of
completed story points when a sprint ends. This number is the velocity of your
team for the sprint.

After completing several sprints, it's a good idea to measure an average
velocity which will help you to understand how many story points you can plan
for the next sprints.

## Why use story points?

Now, when we know what story points are and how to use them, we can summarize
the benefits of story points. Understanding these benefits will shed light on
why teams often choose story points over other methods for estimation and
planning.

- **More Accurate Estimations**. Story points help us to estimate tasks more
  accurately compared to other simple measurements such as time because it takes
  into account multiple measurements, which often impact the estimations, such
  as complexity, amount of work, risks and uncertainties. Besides accuracy, it
  makes it easier to estimate because all the factors are approximate values and
  a team doesn't need to give precise estimations for each factor.
- **Reduced Pressure on Teams**. Since story points aren't tied to time only and
  it's an abstract unit, it reduces pressure on teams which leads to more
  productive work.
- **Improved Team Collaboration**. Story points define an exact process for
  estimating tasks. It involves the whole team into the estimation process and
  gives a common language for estimating which improves communication.
  Techniques such as "Poker planning" make the estimation process more efficient
  and productive.
- **Statistics**. Story points help the team to analyze their performance by
  calculating different metrics such as velocity. Having statistics helps us to
  spot performance issues in advance, discuss it with a team, and plan the next
  sprints more accurately based on the statistics.

## Examples

To better understand story points, let's estimate some tasks together using the
matrix from this guide.

### Task #1. Use pluralization rules for text

**Description**

We need to update all instances in the UI where we use a noun with a dynamic
number to use a function that automatically applies the appropriate
pluralization rule. For example, "1 word", "2 words", etc.

**Additional context**

We're going to use a library which we've used on other projects before. The
codebase is of medium size and it's not hard to search in it.

**Estimation**

- **Time** - 0-2 hours. Knowing the existing code base isn't very big, we're
  pretty sure that this task won't take more than 2 hours.
- **Complexity** - Lowest. There is nothing complex to implement. We don't need
  to implement pluralization from scratch since we're going to use a library for
  that.
- **Amount of work** - Low. It requires us to go through the codebase and find
  places where we need to update text.
- **Risk and uncertainty** - Low. Since we don't know the exact places where we
  need to update text, there is a small risk of underestimating and having more
  places than we initially expected.
- **Points - 1**

### Task #2. Add virtualization to feed

**Description**

We have a feed of users' posts with infinite scroll. We need to implement
virtualization in the list to improve its performance when the list becomes
large.

**Additional context**

We're going to use some library for virtualization but we don't know which one
yet. The list has items with dynamic height. The code for the feed is readable
and written quite well.

**Estimation**

- **Time** - 3-8 hours. We don't need to implement the virtualization logic from
  scratch since we're going to use some library for that. We previously had
  experience of applying virtualization in previous projects, so we know the
  general idea and know approximately how much time it can take.
- **Complexity** - Medium. Virtualization is not a straightforward concept. To
  successfully apply it, we need to understand how it works. We have a dynamic
  height for a list item and an infinite scroll, which complicates the usage of
  virtualization.
- **Amount of work** - Low. Since we had experience previously using some
  libraries for virtualization, we know that, in most cases, it doesn't require
  a lot of changes in the codebase. The code for the feed is written well, and
  it's easy to change and understand.
- **Risk and uncertainty** - Medium. We don't know exactly what library we're
  going to use. There are some risks of something not working as before because
  it changes drastically the way the feed is rendered.
- **Points - 2**. Here we have an uncertain situation because the factors we
  chose don't map to the matrix fully. From the matrix, it should be either 2
  or 3. We ended up choosing 2 because everyone was sure that it wouldn't take
  more than 8 hours, and it was a decisive factor.

### Task #3. Implement login page

**Description**

In the scope of this task, we need to add a new page `/sign-in` which contains a
simple form with `email` and `password` fields and a submit button. We need to
handle errors from API. We also need to establish architecture for
protected/unprotected routes and make the login page available only for
unauthenticated users.

**Additional context**

We're going to use some library for managing forms. We have all basic components
like input, button, etc. in UI kit we use.

**Estimation**

- **Time** - 9-16 hours. Based on previous experience and taking into account
  that we're going to use a lot of existing solutions, we think that it won't
  take more than 16 hours.
- **Complexity** - Low. It contains pretty common functionality. UI doesn't have
  anything complex and most of the components are already ready. All the complex
  form management/validation will handle some library. Amount of work - Medium.
  We need to do several things, like choosing a library for form management,
  communicating with API, handling errors from API, implementing an architecture
  for protected/unprotected routes.
- **Risk and uncertainty** - Low. It's clear how it should work. We know how to
  communicate with API. We have experience working with forms, so even though we
  don't know which library we're going to use, we don't expect a lot of risks
  from it.
- **Points - 3**

### Task #4. Implement chart on dashboard

**Description**

We need to implement a chart on a dashboard which shows some statistics. It's a
bar chart with a tooltip. The design for the chart is custom.

**Additional context**

We're going to use some library for building charts but we don't know which one
yet. We don't have any experience building charts. We need to implement it to
look the same as on the design so we need a library where we can customize the
appearance of charts as we need. We need to think about the loading state, empty
state. We need to communicate with API.

**Estimation**

- **Time** - Unknown. It's hard to estimate how much time it needs since we
  don't have prior experience in implementing charts.
- **Complexity** - High. Data visualization isn't an easy concept and requires
  special knowledge to successfully build custom charts.
- **Amount of work** - High. We need to find a library which covers all our
  requirements. We need to learn the found library and learn data visualization
  in general.
- **Risk and uncertainty** - High. Since we never did it before, there are a lot
  of uncertainties and risks. We don't know which library we're going to use, we
  don't know how hard it's to use that library and which issues it has, we don't
  know how hard it's to learn data visualization.
- **Points - 8**. Even though it might not take much time in the end, we still
  chose 8 because there are a lot of uncertainties.
