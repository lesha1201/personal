Discover how others build real-world Next.js applications by examining their
codebase.

Learning from others' codebases can help you grow as a developer, gain
inspiration for organizing your codebase, develop a certain feature, manage
CI/CD, and much more. You can learn both best practices and some practices to
avoid in real-world scenarios. You can find new technologies that might better
solve certain cases.

In this article, you will find a selection of open-source projects built using
Next.js and App Router.
